# Pedro Urribarri

**Automation & AI Engineer** focused on **Sales & CRM Systems**.  
I design and build **end-to-end automation** that replaces manual processes with **structured, scalable systems**.

## What I build (E2E)

**Lead Capture → Normalization → Business Logic → CRM → Reporting**

- ✅ Structured capture (forms / landing pages / webhooks)
- ✅ Data normalization (phone, names, source, consent)
- ✅ Database-first **dedupe** & integrity rules (MySQL)
- ✅ Ownership & routing logic (teams, territories, SLAs)
- ✅ Perfex CRM automation (custom fields, updates, auditability)
- ✅ KPIs & reporting in near real-time

---

## Core stack

- **n8n** (workflows, webhooks, routing)
- **MySQL** (validation, dedupe, integrity, data model)
- **Perfex CRM** (lead management + custom fields + automation)
- **WordPress** (landing pages + forms + tracking)
